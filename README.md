# MyReads Project

This is my MyReads Project for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree. The app consists of a bookshelf that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read, and search for them.

## How to get started

To get started developing right away:

* `git clone https://github.com/sessia/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git`
* `cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter`
* start the server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Contributing

This repository is a Udacity project. Therefore, I will not accept pull requests.
